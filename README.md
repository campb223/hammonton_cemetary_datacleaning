# DSSA 5102 - Halloween Assignment

## Reformatted Problem Description:
Answer the following question about the cemetary data files:
What is the average (or median) life span for men and women by year?

## Goals of Source Code
1. Combine all the previous year's files with your own collected data into a DataFrame.
2. Remove irrelvant data you do not need for this analysis.
3. Fix any structural errors you encounter (e.g. fixing misspelled words, inconsistent naming conventions, dates with multiple formats etc...)
4. Process any missing data by filling, removing, or leaving it alone. 
5. Add a new column to the pandas dataframe that calculates the life span of each person in your dataset (in years)
6. Identify outliers by using an interquartile range (or Z score) then decide if you should remove them or not.
7. Group your dataframe by Year of birth and pivot the columns by Gender. Finally, compute the mean (or median) life span for values.
8. Finally, email me a link to your github repo for grading.

### Note:
Each line of code needs to have a comment explaining what your code is doing.
Also, try to graph the result using a python library like matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly (a basic bar chart is fine) and include a png of your chart in your repository.
